    a user can earn (via reputation) on any Stack Exchange site.\n \nWhile fairly

    the reputation requirements change as a site matures.\n \nThis method returns
    a list of privileges."

    to calculate privileges themselves, without repeated queries to this method. A
    simple check against the results returned by /privileges and user.user_type would
    be sufficient.\n \n{id} can contain only a single, to find it programatically
    look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.\n \nThis method returns a list
